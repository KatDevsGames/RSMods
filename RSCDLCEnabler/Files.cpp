/*
cache_psarc\cache7.7z\manifests \ tuningdatabase.json - full replacement with our file - "ideally" ability to add to it one entry at a time from the gui.... but low priority.

cache_psarc\cache4.7z\gfxassets\views \ introsequence.gfx - full replacement

cache_psarc\cache4.7z\localization \ maingame.csv - lines to be appended to existing file (base file is 8 mb), pipe dream is gui add entries to match tuningdatabase.json
